# Text-Classification-2022
## Mini Canvas Summary
<details><summary>Motivation</summary>
<p>

Our goal is to develop a tool to classify scientific literature (in general) by category accurately and efficiently. Our primary goal is to classify papers within general subject matters (ex. Physics). If sufficient progress is made we would like to aim for our second goal: to classify texts within subject matters (ex. Physics > Astrophysics) and where these texts can belong in multiple subcategories.  

The end user of this project is an education institution. 

Currently there is a lack of ability to accurately categorize or sort scientific text. Being able to do so can ease processes within library systems, peer review systems, and make it easier for those within the academic realm to find relevant scientific texts.

<details><summary>Data Collection</summary>
<p>

We are planning to use the [ArXiv dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv)

The  dataset backup will be stored in [OneDrive](https://helsinkifi-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mannisjo_ad_helsinki_fi/EebC5gwEI19IqnqSxv5vKFkBVGfp9qzj5Ilf-KSWyLZa9A?e=OlJH7u).  This dataset can be accessed by my group fellows. Moreover, this dataset does not contain any personal information so it can be used further for other research studies. 

There are limitations in the above sources (namely lack of humanities based research papers). At this time we've determined that it is beyond the scope of our project to combine more data to fill this lack of data.
